# 16LF19176 ADC setup using MCC and MPLABX v5.25
------

This is a sample project created with the MPLAB Code 
Configurator to make a simple application to read an ADC input 
voltage then display the raw hex value using UART1 to send an 
ASCII string of characters as serial data.

This application has been tested using only the MPLABX v5.25 
simulator. It seems to work but we all know how crap the 
MPLABX simulations models are so who knows if this will 
work in the real hardware.
